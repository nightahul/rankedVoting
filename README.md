Ranked choice voting system is a preferential voting system in which voters rank the candidates in order of preference rather than voting for a single candidate.
It is used to elect members of the Australian House of Representatives and most Australian State Governments, the President of India, members of 
legislative councils in India, the President of Ireland, and the parliament in Papua New Guinea. It is also used in Northern Ireland by-elections and for
 electing hereditary peers for the British House of Lords.
 
It is also called Instant run-off voting and was devised in 1871 by American architect William Robert Ware.
